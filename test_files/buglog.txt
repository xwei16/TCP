#Bug 1:
did not check sendto() return value correctly. 
Solved by checking if the return value is < 0

# version 44:
timeout.usec = 80000
receiver queue size = 1000

# version 72:
zero_push_size = 256
sst = 120
time_out = 50000 usec

# version 81--88:
zero_push_size = 256
sst = 100
time_out = 40000 usec
